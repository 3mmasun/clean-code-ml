# clean-code-ml refactoring exercise

## Pre-workshop setup

Please ensure you have the following:
- a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) account
- an IDE ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/))
- Windows users:
    - Download [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## Getting started

1. Fork repo
1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clean-code-ml`
1. Run `bin/setup.sh`. This will install miniconda3 if it's not already installed, and install project-level dependencies specified in `./environment.yml`

You're ready to roll! Here are some common commands that you can run in your dev workflow.

```shell
# activate virtual environment
source activate clean-code-ml

# deactivate virtual environment
conda deactivate

# run unit tests
nosetests

# run unit tests in watch mode and color output
nosetests --with-watch --rednose --nologcapture

# start jupyter notebook server
jupyter notebook
# Now you can visit localhost:8888 on your browser.
```

## IDE configuration

Configure your IDE to use `~/miniconda3/envs/clean-code-ml/bin/python` as the Python interpreter. Here are the instructions on how to do that in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html).

Once you've done that, you should be able to:
1. Get helpful auto-complete suggestions in your IDE as you type. If somehow that's not showing up, try restarting your code editor.
1. Let your IDE auto-format your code in a file. We've installed [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) using conda, and now your IDE can help you with the auto-formatting)
    - To do this in VS Code, hit `Shift` + `âŒ˜` + `F`
1. Use other tools provided by your IDE.
    - For VS Code, hit `F1` and type 'Python Refactor' and you can experiment with any of these commands (e.g. 'Sort Imports')
